#### What do managers do ?

Reference [The External Control of Organizations: A Resource Dependence Perspective](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/books/external-control-organizations-resource-dependence-perspective)

#### Think and Reflect

- Business press regularly reports that executive decide to buy-back the shares of their corporations.
- These actions falls under the responsive role of executive towards shareholders demands since these actions will lead to increase of the corporation's stock price.

### What Is the Role of Management in Organizations?

#### Managerial role in value creation: fundamental questions of organizing

- Resource Aquisition: Who should contribute and how much to the collective resource pool ?
- Resource Utilization: For which activities should the collective resources be used ?
- Outcome Allocation: To whome should the benefits of the collective activities be distributed ?

#### Today's Executives' Problem

- Despite historically low interest rates, corporations are sitting on massive ammounts of cash and failing to invest in innovations that might foster growth.
  - Why is this happening ?
  - Who should we blame ?
- Types of innovations executives could invest in
  - Efficiency Innovations : producing and selling established products or services to the same customers at lower prices.
  - Performance improving innovations : replacing old products or services with new and better models.
  - Market creating innovations: radically transforming complicated or costly products or services to create new class of customers and new markets.
    - The introduction of personal computers by Apple and others that replaced mainframe computers.

### Who Are Managers Responsible To?

- What is the capitalist's Dilemma ?
  - Why do companies invest primarily in efficiency innovations, which eliminates jobs, rather than market-creating innovations, which generate jobs?
    - Because firms and their investors believe that **corporate performance should be focused on, and measured by, how efficiently capital is used**.
    - This has an extraordinary impact on how both investors and managers assess opportunities.

<p>Microsoft SQL Server provides a dedicated administrator connection (DAC) which allows an administrator to access a running instance of SQL Server Database Engine to troubleshoot problems on the serverâ€”even when the server is unresponsive to other client connections. The DAC is available through the <strong>sqlcmd</strong> utility and SQL Server Management Studio. The connection is only allowed from a client running on the server. No network connections are permitted. </p>  <p>To use SQL Server Management Studio with the DAC, connect to an instance of the SQL Server Database Engine with Query Editor by typing <strong>ADMIN:</strong> before the server name. Object Explorer cannot connect using the DAC.</p>  <p>To connect to a server using the DAC</p>  <p><a></a></p>  <ol>   <li>     <p>In SQL Server Management Studio, with no other DACs open, on the toolbar, click <strong>Database Engine Query</strong>. </p>   </li>    <li>     <p>In the <strong>Connect to Database Engine</strong> dialog box, in the <strong>Server name</strong> box, type <strong>ADMIN:</strong> followed by the name of the server instance. For example, to connect to a server instance named <strong>ACCT\PAYABLE</strong>, type <strong>ADMIN:</strong><strong>ACCT\PAYABLE</strong>.</p>   </li>    <li>     <p>Complete the <strong>Authentication</strong> section, providing credentials for a member of the <strong>sysadmin</strong> group, and then click <strong>Connect</strong>.</p>      <p>The connection is made.</p>      <p>If the DAC is already in use, the connection will fail with an error indicating it cannot connect.</p>   </li> </ol>  <p>If you are trying to that and got the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><font color="#ff0000">Dedicated administrator connections are not supported. (ObjectExplorer)</font></p> </blockquote>  <p>It means that you are trying to connect Object Explorer using the DAC. Object Explorer cannot connect using the DAC; only Query Window can. That means that you cannot press the New Query button; you have to use the Database Engine Query button.</p>  <p>   <br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/7616/913/1600/pic2440.2.png"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/7616/913/400/pic2440.2.png" width="468" height="302" /></a></p>

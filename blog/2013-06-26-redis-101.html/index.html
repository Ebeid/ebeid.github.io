open-source networked in-memory key-value data store. First released in
2009, currently sponsored by <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a>, and since
then it have been ranked <a href="http://db-engines.com/en/ranking/key-value+store" title="DB-Engines Ranking of Key-value Stores">the most popular key-value store by
DB-Engine</a>.
Redis creator <a href="http://invece.org/" title="Salvatore Sanfilippo aka antirez">Salvatore
Sanfilippo</a>
refers to his project as a “data structure server” to capture its unique
handling of complex data types and other features. Interested ? Enough
talking, let’s get down to business.</p>
<p><strong>Download</strong> Redis installer from
<a href="https://github.com/rgl/redis/downloads">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Installation</strong> is straight forward:</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0037.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0038.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0039.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0040.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0041.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0042.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0043.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<p><strong>Start the Server</strong> go to Control Panel &gt;&gt; Administrative Tools
&gt;&gt; Services , right click <em>Redis Server</em> and select Start.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0044.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<p><strong>Start the Client</strong> look for Redis Client (with red cube icon) in your
start menu and open it. As you see it listens to port 6379 by default.
You could ping your server by writing PING, if everything is good you
will get PONG in return.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0045.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<h3 id="get--set">GET &amp; SET</h3>
<p>As we said before, Redis is a key-value store. We store value inside a
key and retrieve it later using that key. We can use the command SET to
store the value &ldquo;fido&rdquo; at key &ldquo;server:name&rdquo; (server replies with Ok if
everything is good) (Note that we used colons [:] within our key. This
is a valid character that often logically separates a key into segments.
It’s merely a matter of convention, with no deeper meaning in Redis.)</p>
<pre><code> SET server:name &quot;fido&quot;

To retrieve our value, we use GET command (server replies with “fido”)

 GET server:name 

You could also delete a given key and its associated value using DEL command and you can check for key existence using EXISTS (1 exists, 0 otherwise). We get and set multiple values in one command using MSET &amp; MGET

 MSET 1 valueA 2 valueB

 MGET
1 2
</code></pre>
<p>Although Redis stores strings, it recognizes integers and provides some
simple operations for them. If we want to keep a running total of
something, we can create a count and then increment it with the INCR
command (gives error for noninteger values).</p>
<pre><code> SET count 2

 INCR count

 GET count
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0046.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<p>You can also increment by any integer (INCRBY) or decrement (DECR,
DECRBY).</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0047.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<p>It is good to know that these simple operations are atomic in Radis.</p>
<h3 id="expire">Expire</h3>
<p>You can tell Radis to hold a key only for a certain period of time (in
seconds) using EXPIRE command. You can test how long a key will exist
for with the TTL command. It returns the number of seconds until it will
be deleted (-1 means the key will never expire). All keys are permanent
by default.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0048.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<p>Setting and expiring keys is so common that Redis provides a shortcut
command called SETEX. Also at any moment before the key expires, you can
remove the timeout by running PERSIST KeyName.</p>
<p>A common trick for keeping only recently used keys is to update the
expire time whenever you retrieve a value. This will ensure that your
most recently used keys will remain in Redis, while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#Least_Recently_Used">the least recently
used</a>
keys will just expire as normal.</p>
<h3 id="transactions">Transactions</h3>
<p>Redis like most DBMSs supports transactions. We begin the transaction
with the MULTI command and execute it with EXEC command. So, wrapping
two operations like SET and INCR in a single block will complete either
successfully or not at all.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0049.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<p>As you may guess from the server response inside the transaction,
commands are not executed instantly. Instead, they are queued and then
executed in sequence.</p>
<p>Similar to ROLLBACK in SQL, you can stop a transaction with the DISCARD
command, which will clear the transaction queue. Unlike ROLLBACK, it
won’t revert the database; it will simply not run the transaction at
all. The effect is identical, although the underlying concept is a
different mechanism (transaction rollback vs. operation cancellation).</p>
<h3 id="complex-data-types">Complex Data Types</h3>
<p>Radis can store lists, hashes, sets, and sorted sets natively. These
collection data types can contain a huge number of values (up to 2^32
elements or more than 4 billion) per key. That’s more than enough for
all <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> accounts to live as a list under a
single key.</p>
<h4 id="list">List</h4>
<p>A list is a series of ordered values that can act both as queues (first
value in, first value out) and as stacks (last value in, first value
out). Some of the important commands for interacting with lists are
RPUSH, LPUSH, LLEN, LRANGE, LPOP, and RPOP. You can immediately begin
working with a key as a list, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t already exist as a
different type.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RPUSH</strong> puts the new value at the end (right) of the list.</li>
<li><strong>LPUSH</strong> puts the new value at the start (left) of the list.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0050.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LRANGE</strong> gives a subset of the list. It takes the index of the
first element you want to retrieve as its first parameter and the
index of the last element you want to retrieve as its second
parameter. A value of -1 for the second parameter means to retrieve
all elements in the list.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0051.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LLEN</strong> returns the current length of the list.</li>
<li><strong>LPOP</strong> removes the first (left) element from the list and returns it.</li>
<li><strong>RPOP</strong> removes the last (right) element from the list and returns it.
<ul>
<li>Use LPUSH/RPOP to make List act like a queue.</li>
<li>Use LPUSH/LPOP to make List act like a stack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>LREM</strong> removes (some or all) matching elements from the list. It also
requires a number to know how many matches to remove. Setting the count
to 0 as we do here just removes them all. Setting the count greater than
0 will remove only that number of matches, and setting the count to a
negative number will remove that number of<br>
matches but scan the list from the end (right side).</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0052.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RPOPLPUSH</strong> a single command for popping values from the tail of
one<br>
list (right pop) and pushing to the head of another (left push).
Surprisingly, there is no commands for RPOPRPUSH, LPOPLPUSH, or
LPOPRPUSH.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="blocking-lists">Blocking Lists</h4>
<p>It really interesting to know that Redis provides message queuing APIs
natively. So, assume you want to write a simple messaging system where
multiple clients can push data to one side of the queue and one or more
listeners pop data from the other side of the queue. Listeners should
just listen for new data and pop them as they arrive.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BRPOP</strong> the blocking version of RPOP, it blocks the connection
when there are no elements to pop from any of the given lists.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0053.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<p>now open another Redis client window and push a message into messages
list</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0054.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<p>if you switched back to the blocking BRPOP command window, you will find
it return the key, the popped value, and the time spent blocking</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0055.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BLPOP</strong> the blocking version of left pop LPOP</li>
<li><strong>BRPOPLPUSH</strong> the blocking version of right pop left push
BRPOPLPUSH</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="set">Set</h4>
<p>Sets are unordered collections with no duplicate values and are an
excellent choice for performing complex operations between two or more
key values, such as unions or intersections.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SADD</strong> adds the g iven value to the set (duplication is not
allowed).</li>
<li><strong>SREM</strong> removes the given value from the set.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0056.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SISMEMBER</strong> tests if the given value is in the set.</li>
<li><strong>SMEMBERS</strong> returns a list of all the members of this set.</li>
<li><strong>SUNION</strong> combines two or more sets and returns the list of all
elements.</li>
<li><strong>SINTER</strong> returns the intersection of two or more lists.</li>
<li><strong>SDIFF</strong> returns the elements that exist in the first list only but
not in the second list.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0057.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SUNIONSTORE</strong> / <strong>SIMTERUNION</strong> / <strong>SDIFF</strong> stores the result of
operation done on the second and third parameters into the first
parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0058.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMOVE</strong> moves one element from one set to another.</li>
<li><strong>SCARD</strong> counts the set elements (set cardinality).</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0059.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SPOP</strong> returns a random element from a set and removes it.</li>
<li><strong>SRANDMEMBER</strong> returns a random element from a set but does not
remove it</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sorted-sets">Sorted Sets</h4>
<p>Sorted set is similar to a regular set, but now each value has an
associated score. This score is used to sort the elements in the set.
Sorted sets take something from each of the other collections data
types. They are ordered like lists and are unique like sets. They have
field-value pairs like hashes, but rather than string fields, they are
instead numeric scores that denote the order of the values. Internally,
sorted sets keep values in order, so inserts can take log(N) time to
insert (where N is the size of the set), rather than the constant time
complexity of hashes or lists.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ZADD</strong> add a value with a specified score.</li>
<li><strong>ZRANGE</strong> returns the elements between start index (zero-based) and
end index (-1 means to the end of the sorted set. Put <strong>WITHSCORES</strong>
at the end of command to get elements and scores, not only the
elements. To get them in reverse, insert the word REV, as in
<strong>ZREVRANGE</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0060.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ZRANGEBYSCORE</strong> since we are using a sorted set, it’s more likely
to get elements by score ranges instead of index ranges (x &lt;=
score &lt;= y). We can make a score number exclusive by prefixing it
with an opening parenthesis ( x &lt; score &lt;= y).</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0061.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>-inf / inf</strong> negative / positive infinities. can be used in
retrieval (by index or by score). We can also range by both positive
and negative values.</li>
<li><strong>ZREMRANGEBYRANK</strong> / <strong>ZREMRANGEBYSCORE</strong> remove values by rank or
score.</li>
<li><strong>ZINCRBY</strong> Increments the score of member in the sorted set stored
at key by increment. If member does not exist in the sorted set, it
is added with increment as its score (as if its previous score was
0.0). If key does not exist, a new sorted set with the specified
member as its sole member is created. It is possible to provide a
negative value to decrement the score.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0062.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<p><strong>ZUNIONSTORE</strong> Computes the union of numkeys sorted sets given by the
specified keys, and stores the result in destination set. It is
mandatory to provide the number of input keys (numkeys) before passing
the input keys and the other (optional) arguments. Parameters needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>destination ==&gt; a set to hold the union operation result</li>
<li>numkeys ==&gt; number of keys you are going to join.</li>
<li>weight ==&gt; optional num ber(s) to multiply each score of the
relative key by (if you have two keys, you can have two weights and
son on)</li>
<li>aggregate ==&gt; optional rule to specify how the results of the
union are aggregated. This option defaults to SUM, where the score
of an element is summed across the inputs where it exists. When this
option is set to either MIN or MAX, the resulting set will contain
the minimum or maximum score of an element across the inputs where
it exists.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0063.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<p>In the above example we prepared two sorted sets, sset1 with elements (1
“one” 2 “two”) , sset2 with elements (1 “one” 2 “two” 3 “three”). Then
tell Redis to merge these two sets with the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>store the operation result in sorted set named <em>out</em></li>
<li>we going to merge <em>2</em> sorted sets, then provide them <em>sset1 sset2</em>.</li>
<li>we going to use <em>WEIGHTS</em>, then provide these weights <em>2 3</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="hash">Hash</h4>
<p>Hash is a collections object that can hold any number of key-value
pairs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HMSET</strong> store the key-value pairs into the hash (first parameter.</li>
<li><strong>HVALS</strong> returns the values of a hash.</li>
<li><strong>HKEYS</strong> returns the keys of a hash.</li>
<li><strong>HGET</strong> returns the value of of a single key in a hash.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0064.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HDEL</strong> deletes a key-value pair from a hash.</li>
<li><strong>HSET</strong> updates or adds a value at a specified key in a hash.</li>
<li><strong>HINCRBY</strong> increments an integer field value by some count in a
hash. It is possible to provide a negative value to decrement.</li>
<li><strong>HLEN</strong> returns the number of fields in a hash.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0065.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<h4 id="database-namespaces">Database Namespaces</h4>
<p>You may have been wondering, which database we working on. So far, we
have interacted only with a single namespace. In Redis’s terminology, a
namespace is called a <em>database</em> and is keyed by a number. S o far,
we’ve always interacted with the default namespace 0 (also known as
database 0).</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>SELECT</strong> command to switch to different database and provide
it a DB number. Setting a value to a key in one database will not
affect any other key in other databases.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0066.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<ul>
<li>Since all databases are running in the same server instance, Redis
lets us move keys from one database to another with the <strong>MOVE</strong>
command.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/img/0067.png" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p>
<p>This can be useful for running different applications against a single
Redis server but still allow these multiple applications to trade data
between each other.</p>
<h4 id="more-commands">More commands</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>RENAME</strong> rename a key</li>
<li><strong>TYPE</strong> return the type of a key’s value</li>
<li><strong>DEL</strong> deletes a key-value pair</li>
<li><strong>FLUSHDB</strong> removes all keys in database</li>
<li><strong>FLUSHALL</strong> removes all keys from all databases on this server
instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Redis’s data types and the complex queries it can perform make it much
more than a standard key-value store. It can act as a stack, queue, or
priority queue; can be an object store (via hashes); and even can
perform complex set operations such as unions, intersections, and
subtractions (diff). It provides many atomic commands, and for those
multistep commands, it provides a transaction mechanism. It has a
built-in ability to expire keys, which is useful as a cache.</p>
<p>In this post we just introduced Redis as a data structure server. In
later post we going to cover the advanced features of Redis.</p>

<span style="font-family:verdana;">Few days ago I attended a session here in ITWorx called Engineering Processes. It was a very good session by an excellent speaker Alyaa Ali from the process improvement team.<br /><br />I confess that before the session I wasn’t know enough and clear information of the CMMi and its parts and how we apply it, which have changed – thanks for Alyaa – after attending this great session.<br /><br />But what I want to talk about now is a different thing. I got an idea during the session and I can’t stop thinking in it, so I’m writing it now to know your comments about it.<br /><br />Let’s start with a simple question,</span><span style="font-family:verdana;"><span style="color:#000099;"> why clients want software at all? Why they pay a lot of money in it?<br /></span>As the question is simple, the answer is simple too. In abstract, as we learned in faculty, clients need software to automate their current ordinal paper based system. I know that this is a very abstract answer – which may you have comments about it - but can you put it in mind just for a while.<br /><br />Back to the Alyaa’s great session about Engineering Processes or exactly about CMMi.<br />She shows us many documents that are used during the software development phases.<br />Shoe also mentioned a lot tools that is used through different phases by different members having different roles.<br /><br />This led me to think about the software development from a little different perspective, which can be summarized into the following points:</span><br /><ul><li><span style="font-family:verdana;">Software development all in all is an industry like any of our clients’ industry. </span></li><li><span style="font-family:verdana;">We use a lot of documents in our work. </span></li><li><span style="font-family:verdana;">We have many roles in the software development process, having different view points, having different activities in the process. </span></li><li><span style="font-family:verdana;">Software development is a complicated process that is hard to manage.<br /><br />All these and many other – which I can’t list all of them now – have led me to a final big idea.<br /> </span></li></ul><p><span style="font-family:verdana;">Software development process needs an automation system that automates its activities, and achieves the goals that any automated system targets in its life environment.<br /><br />I know it looks a crazy idea and unfeasible. But I think it worth thinking and worth a trail of us.<br /><br />Finally remember that all human achievements, begin with ideas that looks unfeasible and some times begins with dreams</span></p>

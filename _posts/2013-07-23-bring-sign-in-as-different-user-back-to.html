<p>If you new to SharePoint 2013 like me and get confused looking for “Sign in as a Different User” menu command, don’t worry it is not there by design but we can easily bring it back.</p> <p>Do the following steps to get the link back:</p> <ul> <li>Locate the file \15\TEMPLATE\CONTROLTEMPLATES\Welcome.ascx and open it for editing.  <li>Add the following snippet before the existing element that have id of “ID_RequestAccess”. </li></ul> <pre class="prettyprint lang-html"><br /><SharePoint:MenuItemTemplate runat="server" ID="ID_LoginAsDifferentUser"<br /> Text="<%$Resources:wss,personalactions_loginasdifferentuser%>"<br /> Description="<%$Resources:wss,personalactions_loginasdifferentuserdescription%>"<br /> MenuGroupId="100"<br /> Sequence="100"<br /> UseShortId="true"<br /> /><br /></pre><br /><p>Save and close the file. Now you should get the link “Sign in as Different User” back.</p>

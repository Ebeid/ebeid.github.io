This is my first blog post, and I have many things to say but I will talk about one thing which is how this blog have started <br />But before that let me confess that I have different ideas about blogs in all.<br />These ideas have been accumulated over the time and extremely affected by the blogs that I have seen and read in my daily internet use.<br />These ideas can be summarized into few points:<br /><ol><li>The blog should not have only my personal information and memories</li><li>In the blog I should represent myself to the world, represent my ideas and opinions.</li><li>The blog should be different of other blogs.</li><li>The blog should aciqure reader and interest them, and if it fail in that, it should stop and leave the space for the capable people.<br /></li></ol><p>This was my own ideas and it make me think too much each time I think in making my own blog.<br />And every time my thinking led me to the same result, I'm not capable to make a good blog which meets the above mentioned ideas. But I always have ideas and make researches, which I want to share it with other people but there were only one man who I was sharing all my ideas with him. He was the victim of a long years of friendship (True he is my best friend, he called Khaled Mahmoud ). I was always sending him my latest research ideas to discuss it with him. But three days ago I sent one of these mails - I share with Khaled - to another great man called Mohamed Karam.<br />All my words can’t give you the true picture about Mohamed Karam, but I think it is enough for now to say that Mohamed Karam is the Lead Technical Architect of ITWorx, the biggest professional software services company in Egypt.<br />Mohamed replayed to my mail with one main thing, he said that my ideas are interesting and I must have a blog containing these ideas.<br />This replay has beaten my old idea that I’m not capable of writing a good blog. And this blog is the result<br />This is the story of this blog.<br />Finally I would to like thank Mohamed Karam for his encouragement that give me the courage and confidence to start this blog. Of course I would like to thank Khaled Mahmoud for his support and patient to read my mails all during our long years of friendship.</p>

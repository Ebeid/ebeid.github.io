<p>To discuss type checking in programming languages we have to define type checking. Simply,<strong>Type checking</strong> is how type errors are checked. </p>  <p>Type checking could happen at compile-time or at run-time. When type checking happens at the compile-time it is called <strong>Static Type Checking. </strong>When type checking happens at the run-time it is called <strong>Dynamic Type Checking.</strong></p>  <p>Programming Languages differs in </p>  <ul>   <li>when they check types. </li>    <li>Were it enforces types or not. </li> </ul>  <p>Based on these two factors, programming languages could be classified from the type checking perspective into the following classes:</p>  <p><strong>Statically Typed Languages</strong></p>  <blockquote>   <p>In these languages, types are fixed at compile time. Most statically typed languages enforce this by requiring you to declare all variables with their data types before using them</p>    <p>C, Java, and C# are statically typed languages.</p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>Dynamically Typed Languages</strong></p>  <blockquote>   <p>In these languages, types are discovered at execution time; the opposite of statically typed languages. These languages figure out what type a variable is when you first assign it a value.</p>    <p>VBScript and Python are dynamically typed languages.</p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>Strongly Typed Languages</strong></p>  <blockquote>   <p>In these languages, types are always enforced. If you have an integer, you can’t treat it like a string without explicitly converting it.</p>    <p>Java and Python are strongly typed languages.</p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>Weakly Typed Languages</strong></p>  <blockquote>   <p>In these languages, types may be ignored; the opposite of strongly typed languages. In VBScript, you can concatenate the string ‘12’ and the integer 3 to get the string ‘123’, then treat that as the integer 123, all without any explicit conversion.</p>    <p>VBScript is weakly typed language.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Programming languages could be classified based on many other factors and differences which we may discuss in further posts.</p>

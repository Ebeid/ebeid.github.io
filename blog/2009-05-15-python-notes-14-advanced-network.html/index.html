              <p>We have explored the usual issues in network programming, both on client
side and server side. In this post we will discuss some advanced topics
in network programming.</p>
<p><strong>Half-Open Sockets</strong><br>
Normally, sockets are bidirectional—data can be sent across them in both
directions. Sometimes, you may want to make a socket be unidirectional
so data can only be sent in one direction. A socket that&rsquo;s
unidirectional is said to be a half-open socket. A socket is made
half-open by calling shutdown(), and that procedure is irreversible for
that socket. Half-open sockets are useful when</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to ensure that all data written has been transmitted. When
shutdown() is called to close the output channel of a socket, it
will not return until all buffered data has been successfully
transmitted.</li>
<li>You want to have a way to catch potential programming errors that
may cause the program to write to a socket that shouldn&rsquo;t be written
to, or read from a socket that shouldn&rsquo;t be read from.</li>
<li>Your program uses fork() or multiple threads, and you want to
prevent other processes or threads from doing certain operations, or
you want to force a socket to be closed immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>The socket. shutdown() call is used to accomplish all of these tasks.</p>
<p>The call to shutdown() requires a single argument that indicates how you
want to shut down the socket. Its possible values are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 to prevent future reads</li>
<li>1 to prevent future writes</li>
<li>2 to prevent future reads and writes</li>
</ul>
<p>Once shut down in a given direction, the socket can never be reopened in
that direction. Calls to shutdown() are cumulative; calling shutdown(0)
followed by shutdown(1) will achieve the same effect as calling
shutdown(2).</p>
<p><strong>Timeouts</strong></p>
<p>TCP connections can be held open indefinitely, even if there&rsquo;s no
traffic flowing across them. Timeouts are useful<br>
for discovering error conditions or communication problems in some
instances.</p>
<p>To enable timeout detection on a Python socket, you call settimeout() on
the socket, passing it the number of seconds until a timeout is reached.
Later, when you make a socket call and nothing has happened for that
amount of time, a socket.timeout exception is raised.</p>
<p><strong>Transmitting Strings</strong><br>
One common problem that arises when sending data across the network is
that of transmitting variable-length strings. When you read information
from a TCP stream you don&rsquo;t know when the sender has finished giving you
a piece of data unless you build some sort of indication into your
protocol. There are two common approaches to solving this problem:</p>
<p>End-of-string identifier</p>
<p>Terminate the string with ‘\n’ or NULL</p>
<p>Problem: Terminator might occur in the data if we transmit binary data.</p>
<p>Solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Escape the identifier.</li>
<li>Encode data in base64</li>
<li>use different if found in data and send the new identifier before
the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Leading fixed-length size indicator</p>
<ul>
<li>Send a constant number of bytes containing the size of the string.</li>
<li>The “size” itself could be sent as characters or as binary data,
characters are simpler, however you have to pad them to get a
constant length.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using Broadcast Data</strong></p>
<p>When you broadcast a UDP packet, it&rsquo;s sent to all machines<br>
connected to your LAN. The underlying transport, such as Ethernet, will
have a special mode that lets you do this without having to repeat the
packet for each computer.<br>
On the receiver&rsquo;s side, when a broadcast packet is received, the kernel
looks at the destination port number. If it has a process listening to
that port, the packet is sent to that process. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s silently
discarded. Therefore, simply sending out a broadcast packet will not
harm or impact machines that don&rsquo;t have a server listening for it.<br>
Broadcast packets are often used for the following types of activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic service discovery: For instance, a computer might send out
a broadcast packet looking for all print servers of a particular
type.</li>
<li>Automatic service announcements: A server providing a service for a
LAN might periodically broadcast the availability of that service.
Clients would listen for those broadcasts.</li>
<li>Searching for LAN computers that implement a specific protocol. For
instance, a chat program might send out a broadcast packet looking
for other people on the LAN with the same chat program. It might
then compile a list and present it to the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be able to broadcast data, you need to set the socket option on
client and server as follows:</p>
<p>s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, 1)</p>
<p>On the sender, instead of sending to a particular IP, send to
‘&lt;broadcast&gt;’</p>
<p>s.sendto(‘&lt;broadcast&gt;’,123)</p>

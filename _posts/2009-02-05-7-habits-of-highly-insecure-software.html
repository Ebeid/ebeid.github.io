<div align="left"><span style="font-family:verdana;"><strong>Habit # 1: Poorly Constrained Input </strong></span></div><span style="font-family:verdana;">By far, the number one cause of security vulnerabilities in software stems from the failure to properly constrain input. The most infamous security vulnerability resulting from this habit is the buffer overflow. Buffer overflows happen when application developers use languages (like C and C++) that allow them to allocate a fixed amount of memory to hold some user-supplied data. This usually doesn’t present a problem when input is properly constrained or when input strings are of the length that developers expected. When data makes it past these checks, though, it can overwrite space in memory reserved for other data, and in some cases force commands in the input string to be executed. Other unconstrained input can cause problems, too, like escape characters, reserved words, commands, and SQL (Structured Query Language) statements.  </span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;"><strong>Habit # 2: Temporary Files </strong></span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;">Usually we think of the file system as a place to store persistent data; information that will still be there when the power is shut off. Applications, though, also write out temporary files—files that store data only for a short period and then are deleted. Temporary files can create major security holes when sensitive data is exposed. Common (inappropriate) uses of temp files include user credentials (passwords), unencrypted but sensitive information (CD-keys), among others.  </span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;"><strong>Habit # 3: Securing Only the Most Common Access Route </strong></span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;">How many ways could you open a text document in Windows? You could double-click on the file in Windows Explorer; or open your favorite text editor, and type the file name in the open dialog; or type the file name into an Internet Explorer window. The truth is, if you put your mind to it, you could think of at least a dozen ways to open that file. Now imagine implementing some security control on that document. You would have to think of every possible access route to the document, and chances are, you’re likely to miss a few.   Developers fall into this dilemma too. When requirements change, or when a new application version is being developed, security controls are often “added-on” to an application. Also, when a security bug is reported, developers may patch the application to fix the particular input sequence reported and still leave other, underused access routes unprotected. The result: the reappearance of supposedly fixed bugs or alternate access routes that bypass security mechanisms.  </span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;"><strong>Habit # 4: Insecure Defaults</strong> </span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;">We are all guilty of the mortal sin of clicking “Next” or “Finish” on an installation wizard without reading the details and just accept recommended configurations. But is it a sin? The application’s developers and testers know more about the application than we do, so it seems natural not to worry about awkward installation options and just accept defaults. Most users think this way and I can’t say that I blame them. So what does this mean for security-conscious testers? It means that we need to ensure security out of the box. We have to make sure that default values err on the side of security, and that insecure configurations are appropriately explained to users.  </span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;"><strong>Habit # 5: Trust of the Registry and File System Data</strong> </span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;">When developers read information from the registry, they trust that the values are accurate and haven’t been tampered with maliciously. This is especially true if their code wrote those values to the registry in the first place. One of the most extreme vulnerabilities is when sensitive data, such as passwords, is stored unprotected in the registry. We have found that passwords, configuration options, CD keys, and other sensitive data are often stored unencrypted in the registry—ripe for the reading.  </span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;"><strong>Habit # 6: Unconstrained Application Logic</strong> </span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;">It’s pretty clear that we need to examine individual functions to make sure that they are secure. If a feature used in a Web browser is not supposed to allow the reading of any file except a cookie, then there’s a pretty good chance that a test case was run to verify that. Features are not likely to be as well constrained when they are combined or when commands are executed in a loop. Constraining loops can be an exquisitely difficult programming task. Many denial of service attacks are made possible by getting some benign function (such as one that writes out a cookie) to execute over and over again and consume system resources.  </span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;"><strong>Habit # 7: Poor Security Checks with Respect to Time</strong> </span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;">The ideal situation is that every time sensitive operations are performed, checks are made to ensure they will succeed securely. If too much time lapses between time-of-check and time-of-use, then the possibility for the attacker to get in the middle of such a transaction must be considered. It is the old “bait and switch” con applied to computing: Bait the application with legitimate information, and then switch that information with illegitimate data before the application notices.   </span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;"> Using these seven habits as a guideline for your software project will help ensure a successful outcome. There’s no such thing as 100 percent bug free software. Our goal, however, is to get as close as possible.<br /><br /></span><span style="font-family:verdana;"></span>

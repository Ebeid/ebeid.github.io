### What is management

Management is a profession like any other profession. Like any other profession:

- It is based on complex and abstract knowldge
- It require professional education
- It has code of ethics for their role in the society
- It involves both abstract knowledge and experience.

It is a popular profession and it has universal quality education around the world.

#### What do managers do ?

- The Symoblic Role of Mamagement : maintaining the belief that managerial action is responsible for organizational outcomes. Reference [The External Control of Organizations: A Resource Dependence Perspective](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/books/external-control-organizations-resource-dependence-perspective)
- The Responsive Role of Management : evaluating & assessing the demands and constraints confronting the organization
- The Discretionary Role of Management : taking action to modify the future activities of the organization.

#### Think and Reflect

- Business press regularly reports that executive decide to buy-back the shares of their corporations.
- These actions falls under the responsive role of executive towards shareholders demands since these actions will lead to increase of the corporation's stock price.

### What Is the Role of Management in Organizations?

#### Managerial role in value creation: fundamental questions of organizing

- Resource Aquisition: Who should contribute and how much to the collective resource pool ?
- Resource Utilization: For which activities should the collective resources be used ?
- Outcome Allocation: To whome should the benefits of the collective activities be distributed ?

#### Today's Executives' Problem

- Despite historically low interest rates, corporations are sitting on massive ammounts of cash and failing to invest in innovations that might foster growth.
  - Why is this happening ?
  - Who should we blame ?
- Types of innovations executives could invest in
  - Efficiency Innovations : producing and selling established products or services to the same customers at lower prices.
  - Performance improving innovations : replacing old products or services with new and better models.
  - Market creating innovations: radically transforming complicated or costly products or services to create new class of customers and new markets.
    - The introduction of personal computers by Apple and others that replaced mainframe computers.

### Who Are Managers Responsible To?

- What is the capitalist's Dilemma ?
  - Why do companies invest primarily in efficiency innovations, which eliminates jobs, rather than market-creating innovations, which generate jobs?
    - Because firms and their investors believe that **corporate performance should be focused on, and measured by, how efficiently capital is used**.
    - This has an extraordinary impact on how both investors and managers assess opportunities.
- What are possibile solutions to the capitalist dilemma ?
  - Repurposing capital by making investors to stay with the firm:
    - Change tax policy to have more taxes on finanical transactions.
    - Reward shareholders by offering loyalty shares (L-Shares)
  - Rebalancing Business Schools' education by making resource allocation decisions to be more integrated with resource acquisition and outcome allocation.
  - Emancipating Management by making them to focus on the long-term

The answer to all these questions requires an understanding governance and the role of management in it.

- What is corporate governance ?
  - Governance involves the management of relationships between **the management** and **the firm's critical constituencies**.
  - Critial constituencies: Share-holder, employees, managers, customers, suppliers, creditors
  - Who are the constituencies and what to be managed depend on the perspective that define **the relationships** between specific constituencies and **the rules** that are developed to manage these relationships.
  - ![stakeholders](/assets/images/managing-organizations-00001.png "stakeholders")

- Historical origin of shareholders vs stakeholders perspectives
  - In the 1930s two american law professors publicly debated the issue of "to whom are corporations accountable ?"
    - **Adolf A. Berle** : the management of a corporation could only be held accountable to shareholders for their actions.
      - shareholders' interests above everything except the law. 
    - **E. Merrick Dodd** : corporations are accountable to both the society in which they operated and their shareholders.
      - the interests of corporate constituencies are significant factors for the long-term success of the corporation.

### Who Should Monitor the Actions of Executives?

- The role of corporate board of directors in governance:
  - provide strong oversight
  - strategic support for management's efforts to create long-term value
- Continuing emphasis by third parties on building independent boards. (www.icgn.org)
- Where boards fall short https://hbr.org/2015/01/where-boards-fall-short 
  - ![Survey](/assets/images/managing-organizations-00002.png "Survey")
  - The board perspective https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Leadership/The%20board%20perspective/The-board-perspective.ashx

- What firms can do to solve these problems ?
  - Appoint directors with extensive knowledge of their industries
  - Apply retirement rules to balance experience with fresh perspectives
  - Facilitate longer and richer strategic conversations
  - Get boards to engage more with key long-term investors
  - Pay directors more especially for long-term performance

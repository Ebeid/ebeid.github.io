              <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Habit # 1: Poorly Constrained
Input</strong> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->By far, the number one cause of
security vulnerabilities in software stems from the failure to properly
constrain input. The most infamous security vulnerability resulting from
this habit is the buffer overflow. Buffer overflows happen when
application developers use languages (like C and C++) that allow them to
allocate a fixed amount of memory to hold some user-supplied data. This
usually doesn’t present a problem when input is properly constrained or
when input strings are of the length that developers expected. When data
makes it past these checks, though, it can overwrite space in memory
reserved for other data, and in some cases force commands in the input
string to be executed. Other unconstrained input can cause problems,
too, like escape characters, reserved words, commands, and SQL
(Structured Query Language) statements. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>

<!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Habit # 2: Temporary Files</strong>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Usually we think of the file system
as a place to store persistent data; information that will still be
there when the power is shut off. Applications, though, also write out
temporary files—files that store data only for a short period and then
are deleted. Temporary files can create major security holes when
sensitive data is exposed. Common (inappropriate) uses of temp files
include user credentials (passwords), unencrypted but sensitive
information (CD-keys), among others. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>

<!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Habit # 3: Securing Only the Most
Common Access Route</strong> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->How many ways could you open a text
document in Windows? You could double-click on the file in Windows
Explorer; or open your favorite text editor, and type the file name in
the open dialog; or type the file name into an Internet Explorer window.
The truth is, if you put your mind to it, you could think of at least a
dozen ways to open that file. Now imagine implementing some security
control on that document. You would have to think of every possible
access route to the document, and chances are, you’re likely to miss a
few. Developers fall into this dilemma too. When requirements change, or
when a new application version is being developed, security controls are
often “added-on” to an application. Also, when a security bug is
reported, developers may patch the application to fix the particular
input sequence reported and still leave other, underused access routes
unprotected. The result: the reappearance of supposedly fixed bugs or
alternate access routes that bypass security mechanisms. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Habit # 4: Insecure Defaults</strong>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->We are all guilty of the mortal sin
of clicking “Next” or “Finish” on an installation wizard without reading
the details and just accept recommended configurations. But is it a sin?
The application’s developers and testers know more about the application
than we do, so it seems natural not to worry about awkward installation
options and just accept defaults. Most users think this way and I can’t
say that I blame them. So what does this mean for security-conscious
testers? It means that we need to ensure security out of the box. We
have to make sure that default values err on the side of security, and
that insecure configurations are appropriately explained to users.

<!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Habit # 5: Trust of the Registry
and File System Data</strong> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->When developers read information from
the registry, they trust that the values are accurate and have n’t been
tampered with maliciously. This is especially true if their code wrote
those values to the registry in the first place. One of the most extreme
vulnerabilities is when sensitive data, such as passwords, is stored
unprotected in the registry. We have found that passwords, configuration
options, CD keys, and other sensitive data are often stored unencrypted
in the registry—ripe for the reading. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Habit # 6: Unconstrained
Application Logic</strong> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->It’s pretty clear that we need to
examine individual functions to make sure that they are secure. If a
feature used in a Web browser is not supposed to allow the reading of
any file except a cookie, then there’s a pretty good chance that a test
case was run to verify that. Features are not likely to be as well
constrained when they are combined or when commands are executed in a
loop. Constraining loops can be an exquisitely difficult programming
task. Many denial of service attacks are made possible by getting some
benign function (such as one that writes out a cookie) to execute over
and over again and consume system resources. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Habit # 7: Poor Security Checks
with Respect to Time</strong> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The ideal situation is that every
time sensitive operations are performed, checks are made to ensure they
will succeed securely. If too much time lapses between time-of-check and
time-of-use, then the possibility for the attacker to get in the middle
of such a transaction must be considered. It is the old “bait and
switch” con applied to computing: Bait the application with legitimate
information, and then switch that information with illegitimate data
before the application notices. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Using these seven habits as a
guideline for your software project will help ensure a successful
outcome. There’s no such thing as 100 percent bug free software. Our
goal, however, is to get as close as possible.</p>

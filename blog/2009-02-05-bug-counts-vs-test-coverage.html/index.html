              <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->**What to Do When Bug
Counts Don’t Speak for Themselves?**<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bug counts on a project speak volumes
about the quality of testing for a particular product and how vigorous
the test team is working to &ldquo;assure quality.&rdquo; Bug counts are invariably
a primary area of test metrics that are reported to management. What is
the rationale behind drawing so much attention to the number of bugs
being found through the course of a project?<br>
I have heard it said that QE’s job is to find bugs. If this is the
assumption of management, bug counts will be an important indicator to
them that QE is doing its job. They expect to see bug counts rise
dramatically in the early stages of testing, and they expect to see the
find rate decrease as the project comes to an end. These are
management’s statistical expectations when they believe bug counts are a
metric to assess quality of testing.<br>
If high bug counts, then, are an indicator that quality is going up, low
bug counts can be seen as an indicator that something just isn’t right
with the testing process. Management might imagine different problems
that are preventing bugs from being found:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ul>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Test coverage isn’t complete;
maybe major areas of functionality aren’t being tested. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Testing is only scratching the
surface of all functionality, not digging in to the real
complexities of the code. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our testers just aren’t that
good.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Management might see red flags when
bug counts are low, but a number of causes may contribute to low bug
counts. On the second or third iteration of a product, the bulk of the
defects may have been found on an earlier cycle. Or especially good
development practices may have been implemented: strong unit testing,
code reviews, good documentation, and not working developers to death.
These are supposed to result in lower bug counts.<br>
Ultimately, however, QE will justify low bug counts when it can justify
its test coverage. If the product under test is being tested with
thorough coverage, the bug count should be treated only as a supporting
statistic, not the primary one. After all, <strong>we all know that a quality
product hasn’t been reached when a certain bug count is reached. Quality
is achieved when test coverage is maximized and bug finds decrease to a
minimum.</strong><br>
There are several things you can do when bug counts are low and
management is questioning the quality of testing:<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ol>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Take stock</strong>. Call a meeting
with your test team, go through the areas of test, possibly even
some test cases themselves, and get a general feel for how much test
coverage you really have. Maybe you’ll discover that an area of test
really is being missed. Perhaps there is some misunderstanding of
who should be testing what and some functionality fell between the
cracks. Brainstorm more testing methods and techniques, and generate
ideas of how your team can broaden the testing efforts. Before going
to other groups or departments, get a solid understanding of where
your team is in the process. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Talk to development</strong>. Go over
your current test coverage with development, and see if they have
any input on areas you might also investigate. Ask them what the
trouble spots are, if they can suggest lower-level tests that may
ferret out more bugs, and possibly even conduct a test case review
with them. On my last project, we sent out the test cases of a
certain functionality to the appropriate developer for review.
Though many times developers can be reluctant to help testers,
demonstrate to t hem that it is in their best interest that we
thoroughly test their code—if it’s solid, they have nothing to worry
about. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Communicate with management</strong>.
When bug counts are low, use test coverage to justify them. This
doesn’t mean dismissing the fact that the bug count is low. It means
using the bug count as an indicator to do some analysis into the
testing practices you are doing, and verifying that high test
coverage is being achieved. If it is, explain to management your
findings. Demonstrate by solid metrics that you are performing
thorough testing, that you can’t force bug counts to go up, and that
maybe—just maybe—a low bug count means you’ve got a quality product
on your hands!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ol>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One thing to bear in mind: while you
can use the above methods during testing cycles to understand and cope
with a low bug count, the ideas are still applicable before testing even
begins, while test cases are being written for a project, and while
development is still in full swing. Good test coverage is something to
be planned ahead of time, and having gone through the effort of mapping
coverage and functional test cases early in the project, you will
prevent yourself from spending valuable testing cycles repeating
tasks.<br>
While low bug counts can cause people in both development and management
to question the effectiveness of the testing, do not be defensive about
it. Use it as a trigger to prove what you should already know—your
testing efforts are appropriate, effective, and your coverage is
maximized. Don’t let your bug counts do the talking—your test coverage
should say it all.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

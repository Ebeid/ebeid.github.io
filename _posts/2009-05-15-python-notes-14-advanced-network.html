<p>We have explored the usual issues in network programming, both on client side and server side. In this post we will discuss some advanced topics in network programming.</p>  <p><strong>Half-Open Sockets</strong>     <br />Normally, sockets are bidirectional—data can be sent across them in both directions. Sometimes, you may want to make a socket be unidirectional so data can only be sent in one direction. A socket that's unidirectional is said to be a half-open socket. A socket is made half-open by calling shutdown(), and that procedure is irreversible for that socket. Half-open sockets are useful when </p>  <ul>   <li>You want to ensure that all data written has been transmitted. When shutdown() is called to close the output channel of a socket, it will not return until all buffered data has been successfully transmitted. </li>    <li>You want to have a way to catch potential programming errors that may cause the program to write to a socket that shouldn't be written to, or read from a socket that shouldn't be read from.</li>    <li>Your program uses fork() or multiple threads, and you want to prevent other processes or threads from doing certain operations, or you want to force a socket to be closed immediately.      <br /></li> </ul>  <p>The socket. shutdown() call is used to accomplish all of these tasks. </p>  <p>The call to shutdown() requires a single argument that indicates how you want to shut down the socket. Its possible values are as follows: </p>  <ul>   <li>0 to prevent future reads </li>    <li>1 to prevent future writes </li>    <li>2 to prevent future reads and writes </li> </ul>  <p>Once shut down in a given direction, the socket can never be reopened in that direction. Calls to shutdown() are cumulative; calling shutdown(0) followed by shutdown(1) will achieve the same effect as calling shutdown(2). </p>  <p><strong>Timeouts</strong></p>  <p>TCP connections can be held open indefinitely, even if there's no traffic flowing across them. Timeouts are useful    <br />for discovering error conditions or communication problems in some instances. </p>  <p>To enable timeout detection on a Python socket, you call settimeout() on the socket, passing it the number of seconds until a timeout is reached. Later, when you make a socket call and nothing has happened for that amount of time, a socket.timeout exception is raised. </p>  <p><strong>Transmitting Strings</strong>     <br />One common problem that arises when sending data across the network is that of transmitting variable-length strings. When you read information from a TCP stream you don't know when the sender has finished giving you a piece of data unless you build some sort of indication into your protocol. There are two common approaches to solving this problem: </p>  <ul>   <li>End-of-string identifier</li>    <ul>     <li>Terminate the string with ‘\n’ or NULL</li>      <li>Problem: Terminator might occur in the data if we transmit binary data.</li>      <li>Solutions:</li>      <ul>       <li>Escape the identifier.</li>        <li>Encode data in base64</li>        <li>use different if found in data and send the new identifier before the data.</li>     </ul>   </ul>    <li>Leading fixed-length size indicator</li>    <ul>     <li>Send a constant number of bytes containing the size of the string.</li>      <li>The “size” itself could be sent as characters or as binary data, characters are simpler, however you have to pad them to get a constant length.</li>   </ul> </ul>  <p><strong>Using Broadcast Data</strong></p>  <p>When you broadcast a UDP packet, it's sent to all machines    <br />connected to your LAN. The underlying transport, such as Ethernet, will have a special mode that lets you do this without having to repeat the packet for each computer.     <br />On the receiver's side, when a broadcast packet is received, the kernel looks at the destination port number. If it has a process listening to that port, the packet is sent to that process. Otherwise, it's silently discarded. Therefore, simply sending out a broadcast packet will not harm or impact machines that don't have a server listening for it.     <br />Broadcast packets are often used for the following types of activities: </p>  <ul>   <li>Automatic service discovery: For instance, a computer might send out a broadcast packet looking for all print servers of a particular type.</li>    <li>Automatic service announcements: A server providing a service for a LAN might periodically broadcast the availability of that service. Clients would listen for those broadcasts.</li>    <li>Searching for LAN computers that implement a specific protocol. For instance, a chat program might send out a broadcast packet looking for other people on the LAN with the same chat program. It might then compile a list and present it to the user. </li> </ul>  <p>To be able to broadcast data, you need to set the socket option on client and server as follows:</p>  <p><font color="#0000ff">s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, 1)</font> </p>  <p><font color="#000000">On the sender, instead of sending to a particular IP, send to ‘&lt;broadcast&gt;’</font></p>  <p><font color="#0000ff">s.sendto(‘&lt;broadcast&gt;’,123)</font></p>  <p><font color="#000000"></font></p>  <p><font color="#000000">In this post we dealt with a few advanced issues in network programming.</font></p>

### The process of value creation

- Understanding your firm's environment  and business model
- Building a strategy to compete better
- Designing the organization
- Executing the strategy effectively

### Critical contingencies and core organizational process

Contingencies are things that you can't directly control or manipulate 
- **Business Model** : How does the existing business model of our industry (including givernment regulations, technological changes and customer preferences) influence our choices ?
- **Industry History and Life-Cycle** : How do historical changes in an industry infleuence organizational action ?
- **Operational Technology** : How does the combination of skills, knowledge, tools, techniques, and actions that are used to convert organizational inputs into outputs influence structure ?
- **Firm Strategy** : How are the adjustments and changes made to startegy incorporated into structure ?

### Intial questions to start your thinking

**What is a business model ?** Business model is how our industry makes money
**How does a business model shape the organization design ?**

### Competing business models: the credit card industry

- What is a business model ?
    - A business model is a set of well established expectations in an industry about the ways the industry participants create value for all its players especially its customers.
- What is a **new** business model ?
    - A new business model is the act of converting an insight into an executable business that is continually tested in the marketplace.
- How does a business model evolve ?
    - A new business model is always a variation on some aspects of an existing value chain.
    - There are always more than one business model operating in a given market, and in most cases they are competing.

### Basic elements of a card system

### Game-changer in business models

- New, game-changing buinsess models rarely emerge from established bsinesses. Why ?
    - Existing companies usually execute a well-understood business model
    - New start-ups looks for a new business model

### The case of the changing music industry

#### Music Industry

- A short history of recorded music industry
- Alternative business models today
    - Apple iTunes
    - Pandora
    - Spotify
- What is the nature of new business model

### Industry Life Cycle

#### How to convert new insights into business enterprises

- Discovering the taken for granted conventions of your industry
- Identify the structural problems in your industry that 
    - create bottlenecks and 
    - shape the cost or revenue structure of all firms
- Rethink the key activities performed by your firm and discover new potential partners

#### Organizational design consequences 

Business models directly address the following questions:
- What is the boundry of your firm ?
- Which activities should be performed by your firm or by your external partners ?
- What is the value proposition your firm provide to its customers ?

#### External contingency: industry life-cycle

- Effects of legitimacy & competition

### Trajectories of Industry Change

- External contingency: Idustry change
    - Industries and organizatons change because of two fundamental changes in their environments:
        - Change in core activities which are the recurring activities performed in order to attract input providers and customers who by the product or services
        - Change in core assets which are the resources that make the firms to carry out the core activities.

[TODO] screenshot

#### Internal contingency: Operations Technology

It is the combination of skills, knowledge, tools, techniques, and actions that are used to convert organizational inputs into outputs.
- What are the critical tasks to be performed ?
- Where are these tasks performed ?
- Who performs them ?
- When are they performed ?
- What are the relationships among these tasks ?

### The relationship among major task categories

**Primary operational transformations in organizations:**

- Product design and development (P)
- Production (P)
- Sales (marketing and distribution) (S)

**Possible sequences of these primary transformations**
- D > P > S [Feasible: Design comes before production]
- D > S > P [Feasible: Design comes before production]
- S > D > P [Feasible: Design comes before production] 
- S > P > D [Not feasible]
- P > D > S [Not feasible]
- P > S > D [Not feasible]

### Types of operational technology
- Small-batch/Unit   S > D > P
- Large-batch/Mass   D > P > S
- Continuous Process D > S > P

### Types of workflow interdependencies
 
 - In a resturant, the key tasks are : Cook, Serve, Order, Pay, Eat
 - Family Resturant : Order, Cook, Serve, Eat, Pay
    - Deliver bigger menu, but slower
 - Fast-food Resturant : Cook, Order, Pay, Serve, Eat
    - Deliver smaller menu, but faster
- Sequence doesn't have to be one directional in every organization
- Types of workflow interdependencies
    - Pooled: each department or unit contributes separately to the performance of the whole organization. [Low interdependencies]
    - Sequential: actions of one unit directly affect the actions of another unit in a predetermined sequence. [Medium interdependencies]
    - Reciprocal: actions of one unit affect the actions of other units but the sequence is not predetermined. [High interdependencies]

With interdependencies comes high coordination mechanisms.

### How do you know that your strategy for competitive advantage is not working

If some (5) of the following statements are true:

- Our investment decisions are not producing any meaningful return.
- Competition is emerging from places we didn't expect
- Customers are finding cheaper or similar solutions
- Customers are no longer excited about what we have to offer
- We are unable to attract critical talent
- Some of our very best talent are leaving
- Our stock is not gaining any value
- I don't buy my own company's products or services

### Summary

- Contingencies are factors that directly influence our organizational design
- Contingencies are both external and internal
- Contingencies are not static but constantly changing
